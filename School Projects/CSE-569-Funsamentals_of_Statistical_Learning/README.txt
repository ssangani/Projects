We assume that the trainData.mat and testData.mat are present in the same directory where our code is present. We also assume that libSVM is installed in MATLAB.

To the run the code, please run FSL_Vignesh_Sagar.m in MATLAB. This code will run the implementation steps one by one and the results will be created in the workspace.
We have appended all the result variable names with the step number associated with each step.

The trX1.txt.fscore file contains the fscore values of the features associated with training data X1. Similarly we have created the fscores for X2 and X3. These were generated by the feature selection tool by libSVM
